## Summary

This document provides an overview, project spec, and wireframes for our team's capstone project: CineSpeak/TalkFlix is an app **that allows users to search for movies to practice a language they are trying to learn.

## Notes

As a group we collectively focused on a singular API (TMDB) and came up with various ideas for utilizing it. Our final idea (name pending between CineSpeak & Talkflix) was an almagamation of all team member wireframes, which incorpoated drop down menus for filter settings, a search bar for specific queries, as well as a scrolling recyclerview for filtered movie results. Stretch features include addiitonal views for movie details if time permits.
